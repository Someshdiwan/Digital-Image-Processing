## 🚀 Overview  

Digital Image Processing (DIP) involves manipulating images to enhance their appearance or extract useful information. In this project, we demonstrate common image processing techniques in Python using libraries such as *OpenCV* and *Pillow*.

- **Contrast Stretching**: Expands the range of pixel intensity values.
- **Brightness Adjustment**: Changes the brightness of the image.
- **Image Inversion**: Reverses pixel colors (e.g., black becomes white).

These techniques are essential for applications like image enhancement, analysis, and feature extraction.

## 🔧 Features  

- **Contrast Stretching**: Adjusts the contrast of the image by modifying its intensity levels.
- **Brightness Adjustment**: Changes the brightness of an image without affecting contrast.
- **Image Inversion**: Inverts pixel values to produce a negative effect.
- **Sample Code**: Includes Python code for each technique with detailed explanations.
- **Visual Examples**: Side-by-side comparisons of original and processed images for better understanding.
